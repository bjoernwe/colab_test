# Safe and Sound Protocol (SPP)

**Abstract:** A Jupyter notebook that modulates the frequencies of a given audio file in a way that is similar to the Safe and Sound Protocol (SPP).

**Background:** The [Safe and Sound Protocol](https://integratedlistening.com/ssp-safe-sound-protocol/) is a therapeutic treatment protocol based on [Polyvagal Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory) that has application in autism treatment and trauma therapy. Its basic idea is to exercise the middle-ear muscles to increase their capacity of filtering out low frequency sounds and tune into higher frequencies - which in turn can support reaching or maintining a physiological state of safety.

**Scope:** _This is a purely private code project that allows me to look into the science of SPP more closely. Note that beyond this scope, SPP is based on patented ideas and its commercial availability is restricted to licenced professionals._
